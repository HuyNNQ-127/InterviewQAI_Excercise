# InterviewQAI_Excercise: Machine Learning Methods on MNIST Dataset

This document provides links to detailed exercises on applying various machine learning methods to the MNIST dataset. Each exercise focuses on different aspects of model building, evaluation, and optimization.

## Exercises

1. **[Triplet Loss](Excercise_No_1.md)**  
   This exercise covers the implementation and evaluation of triplet loss in a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), including the impact of different batch sizes on accuracy and training time.

2. **[Building ML Models](Excercise_No_2.md)**  
   Explore various machine learning models including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Decision Trees. This exercise includes a comparison of model performance with and without PCA for feature reduction.

3. **[Extended Triplet Loss](Excercise_No_3.md)**  
   Delve into the extended triplet loss approach, which incorporates multiple positive and negative samples. The exercise provides an explanation and implementation details for handling multiple pairs in the triplet loss function.
